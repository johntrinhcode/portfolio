Hey! This is the first blog post for my re-vamped portfolio/resume website. After a year of working professionally since
graduating from university I thought it'd be a good time to give it a refresh.  

I wanted to learn a couple of new things along the way too. The goal was to teach myself with **React**, strengthen my 
familiarity with **Tailwind CSS** and look into other fun tools I could incorporate into this site. (More on that later!)


## Design Choices
### React
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a hugely popular javascript library for building UI that I just haven't had the chance to mess around with.
I spent a lot of college learning Vue as it was the first frontend framework that I gravitated to. Once I started work I
was able to add Angular to my toolset, leaving React as the last of the "Big 3" frontend frameworks/libraries that I've yet to learn.  

The differences between the 3 could take up it's own blog post but off the bat it was very apparant to me that React is it's own beast
compared to Angular and Vue in terms of how it approaches frontend development.  

I decided to use [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org) as my React framework of choice to take advantage of all of the nice SSR and page-route mappings it comes bundled with.

### Tailwind CSS  
I **love** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's grown super popular amongst devs and teams and has received a bunch of updates in the past year. It's one of my favorite tools 
when it comes to styling components by giving me a bunch of CSS utility classes out of the box and then tree shaking all of the unused
classes out of the bundle upon building.  

Until I have a reason not to, Tailwind CSS is usually an automatic include in my projects. ü§∑

### Markdown
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is an awesome lightweight markup language that I wanted to build my blog on top of!  

`next-mdx-enhanced` is a cool little Next.js plugin that allows you to create MDX pages, layout and frontmatter. With 
MDX files (basically Markdown files that let you include React components in them) I'm able to simplify how I manage, format 
and store my blog posts. Each blog post is held within it's own `.mdx` file and includes frontmatter data
that I can set like the blog post title, timestamp, slug, etc.

```

The content of each blog post is then fed into a layout component for display which keeps the look between each post nice and consistent.  

# What's next?
There are a bunch of stuff I'd like to implement down the road but some that immediately come to mind:  

### Clean up üßº
A lot of time when I try something new I like to just get it to a point where it **works**. Although thats great for 
learning new technologies and getting something up quickly, it can be a detriment to code readbility and maintainability.

### Projects Section üìù
My frontpage is missing a "Projects" section! Not that I don't have any projects to mention.. I do.. except that they're old, outdated
and not representative of my skillset these days. Turns out when you've got a full time job it can be sort of hard to find time in the
day to work on your own projects especially if you're juggling other things in life! Time management has a bit easier these days though and 
I try to carve out some time everyday to fix that.. so expect something in this section soon! 

### Dark Mode üåô
Dark mode is a super cool little addition that would be fun and easy to implement with Tailwind CSS's [Dark Mode Feature](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode).

### Blog Comments and Likes üí¨
Naturally, a blog would do good with the capability for readers to engage by adding comments or "liking" a post. This will be the change that'll
likely require a proper database and backend.
