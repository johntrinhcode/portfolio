Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the repo of my personal site.

This project is ever-changing as I learn new things and find time to apply them (or just feel like adding new stuff).

It is currently built using the following tools:
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Spotify API

If you've got any questions or want to get in touch feel free to reach me at **johntrinhcode@gmail.com**.

## Running locally
- Clone this repository to your machine.
- Install all dependencies by running the `yarn` command on the root directory.
- Spin up the website locally with `yarn dev`.
