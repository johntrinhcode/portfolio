## Fresh coat of paint

In what seems like a yearly tradition, I went through another round of revamping my personal website.
This time around was pretty fun and I had a good time redesigning the look to this _glass pane_ aesthetic.

The site is built with **React 18** and **Next.js**. There are a couple other libraries and APIs sprinkled in there to let me
do things like display my currently playing Spotify song or derive posts like this from a Markdown file.

## Inspiration

There are plenty of exceptional portfolio websites out there that I've stumbled across on Twitter, Reddit and other places that
inspired me to give it another whirl.

Some of my favorites:

- [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/)
- [Rally](https://rallyinteractive.com/)
- [Igor Bedesqui](https://www.igorbedesqui.com/)

## On to the next

I think I'm pretty satisfied with the base that I've established here and believe it's good enough to start pushing out some posts and random thoughts.
This time around also feels much more deliberate. The last iteration of my personal site was made while I was still learning the ropes
of React and Next.js. Now that I'm using both of these tools at my day job, I've gotten a lot more comfortable with two!

Anywho, here is the [Github](https://github.com/johntrinhcode/portfolio) if you're interested.

Here's to an awesome 2023! ðŸ¤
